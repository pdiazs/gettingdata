Getting and cleaning data homework

IMPORTANT: 
The script assumes your data are in the default wd in R if you want to move to a different place 
just change the character ~ to a specific location where the UCI HAR Dataset folder is located.

The script has been tested in Rstudio Version 0.98.501  withh R X64 3.03

If you load manually the data be aware omittin headers when necessary 

Copy paste the script in R or just type:
> source("run_analysis.R")
> run_analysis

At the end you will see the table in the archive area in the screen (view-> Show->files)
